##Introduction

This application connects to Twitter using [Application-only authentication](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only).

So you have to run it with your own credentials.

You can obtain your consumer key and secret by creating a new app on [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/).


Then you have to set the value of the environment variables:

```sh
$ export CONSUMER_KEY="Your consumer key"
$ export CONSUMER_SECRET="Your consumer secret"
```


The application can be started in two different modes, client or server:

- The client mode allows you to perform a search on twitter and display the results in the console standard output.

- The server mode starts a webapp and provides a web UI.


##Run the client

```sh
# start the client
$ go run main.go -client "#Arduino"
```

You should see:

                }
            ]
        }
    },
    ...
```


##Run the server

```sh
# install dependencies listed in bower.json
$ bower install

# start the webapp
$ go run main.go -server
```

Go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to run the web UI.
