##Introduction

This application connects to Twitter using [Application-only authentication](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only).

So you have to run it with your own credentials.

You can obtain your consumer key and secret by creating a new app on [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/).


Then you have to set the value of the environment variables:

```sh
$ export CONSUMER_KEY="Your consumer key"
$ export CONSUMER_SECRET="Your consumer secret"
```


##Run the client

```sh
# start the client
$ go run client.go "#Arduino"
```

You should see:

                }
            ]
        }
    },
    ...
```


##Run the server

```sh
# install dependencies listed in bower.json
$ bower install

# start the webapp
$ go run server.go
```

Go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to run the web UI.
